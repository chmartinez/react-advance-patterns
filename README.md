# React Advance Patterns (with hooks)

This repo has some examples on how we could implement some of the most common React patterns using hooks.

## How to run the code

* `yarn` to install dependencies.
* `yarn start` to start the server.


**TODO**

* [ ] Add some love to the page (in terms of styling)
* [x] ~~Re-structure the code and make it modular (or at least cleaner)~~
